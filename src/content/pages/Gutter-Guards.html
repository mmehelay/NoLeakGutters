                <p class="cs-item-text">
                   Mesh screen gutter guards are the most cost-efficient option. These typically resemble fencing or mesh that include a variety of hole sizes to help keep debris from flowing into your gutters.

                <h3 class="cs-h3">Perforated Aluminum Gutter Guards</h3>
                <p class="cs-item-text">
               Perforated aluminum gutter guards are typically made from roll-form aluminum. These do not become brittle over time and won't warp or bend when exposed to high temperatures.

                <h3 class="cs-h3">Micro-Screen Gutter Guards</h3>
                <p class="cs-item-text">
                   Because of their fine steel or aluminum micro-mesh barrier layer, micro-screen gutter guards are the most effective option on the market. They block nearly all debris ranging from pine needles to shingle grit.
